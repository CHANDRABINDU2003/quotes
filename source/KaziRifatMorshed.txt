"জীবনে কি হইতে চাই? মানুষ হইতে চাই। বেশি উপরে উঠতে চাইনা, যাতে নিচের মানুষগুলোকে তুচ্ছ পিঁপড়ার মত দেখায়। বেশি নিচে নামতে চাইনা যাতে সবাই আমাকে পিঁপড়া ভেবে মাড়িয়ে দেয়। খুব ইচ্ছা আছে, একদিন নিজেকে মানুষ দাবী করবো।" - রায়হান রাহী (NSTU)
“An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it if you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius” ― Terry Davis
